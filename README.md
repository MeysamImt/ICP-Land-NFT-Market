## ICP Land Furniture NFT marketplace

Based on the Ryno NFT Marketplace template made with chakra UI for the BitFinity community

Open [Demo Website](https://icp-land-furniture.netlify.app/) to see the Marketplace DEMO.

# Modifications
Contract is deployed on the [bitfinity network testnet](https://www.blog.bitfinity.network/how-to-deploy-a-solidity-smart-contract-to-the-bitfinity-evm/) at address 0x6e8d3a3c832b76f5d2844f0830477d74700d0767
mintNFT function has been modified to accept another argument (Name: string) in order for the 3D interface to be able to retrieve both 3D files and rendered picture when needed.

The idea is for people to view only the owned NFTs in the store gallery on the [ICP Land metaverse](https://icp-land.netlify.app/) and be able to modify the furniture of each room if they have the password.


## To Do 

Ownership check on wallet login on the metaverse interface, by now you see all the demo furniture on the market page in the metaverse, check the [ICP Land repository](https://github.com/jilt/ICP-Land) to get the demo password.
A serious discussion with BitFinity community to create a new standard for 3D NFTs and their new metaverse.
